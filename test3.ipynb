      "Sure! Quick sort is a popular sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. Here is a Python implementation of the Quick sort algorithm:\n",

      "def quick_sort(arr):\n",
      "    if len(arr) <= 1:\n",
      "        return arr\n",
      "    else:\n",
      "        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n",

      "        return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n",

      "### Explanation:\n",
      "1. **Base Case**: If the array has 0 or 1 elements, it is already sorted, so return the array.\n",
      "2. **Pivot Selection**: Choose a pivot element from the array. Here, we choose the middle element.\n",
      "3. **Partitioning**:\n",
      "   - `left`: Elements less than the pivot.\n",
      "   - `middle`: Elements equal to the pivot.\n",
      "   - `right`: Elements greater than the pivot.\n",
      "4. **Recursive Sorting**: Recursively apply the quick sort to the `left` and `right` partitions.\n",
      "5. **Combine**: Concatenate the sorted `left`, `middle`, and `right` partitions to get the sorted array.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage:\n",
      "The example usage demonstrates how to use the `quick_sort` function to sort an array. The original and sorted arrays are printed to the console.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can modify the pivot selection strategy or the partitioning logic if needed, but this implementation provides a basic and efficient way to perform quick sort in Python.\n"
