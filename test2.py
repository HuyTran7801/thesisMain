            You are a role of an expert in coding.
            Exercise:
            Due to a shortage of teachers in the senior class of the "T-generation", 
            it was decided to have a huge male gorilla conduct exams for the students. 
            However, it is not that simple; to prove his competence, he needs to solve the following problem.
            For an array b, we define the function f(b) as the smallest number of the following operations required to make the array b empty:
            take two integers l and r, such that l≤r, and let x be the min(bl,bl+1,…,br); then remove all such bi that l≤i≤r
            and bi=x from the array, the deleted elements are removed, the indices are renumerated.
            You are given an array a of length n and an integer k
            . No more than k times, you can choose any index i (1≤i≤n) and any integer p, and replace ai with p.
            Help the gorilla to determine the smallest value of f(a)
            that can be achieved after such replacements.
            Input
            Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t
            (1≤t≤10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
            The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n
            and k (1≤n≤10^5, 0≤k≤n) — the length of the array a
            and the maximum number of changes, respectively.
            The second line of each set of input data contains n
            integers a1,a2,…,an (1≤ai≤10^9) — the array a itself.
            It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n
            across all sets of input data does not exceed 105
            .
            Output
            For each set of input data, output a single integer on a separate line — the smallest possible value of f(a)
            .
            Input:
            6
            1 0
            48843
            3 1
            2 3 2
            5 3
            1 2 3 4 5
            7 0
            4 7 1 3 2 4 1
            11 4
            3 2 1 4 4 3 4 2 1 3 3
            5 5
            1 2 3 4 5
            Output:
            1
            1
            2   
            5
            2
            1
            Note
            In the first set of input data, f([48843])=1
            , since the array consists of a single number, and thus it can be removed in one operation.

            In the second set of input data, you can change the second number to 2
            , resulting in the array [2,2,2]
            , where f([2,2,2])=1
            , since you can take the entire array as a subarray, the minimum on it is 2
            , so we will remove all the 2
            s from the array, and the array will become empty.
            Write a code by C++ about it
